## My experience in mandelbrot project
The first thing that I did was searching and asking about this project.I asked my friend and one of the TAs about the project and how each function works.It takes a week to learn each part of the project. Then I started to work at it. I made my first pictures in python(you can find these pictures in my Azure account in python file) to test which color I rather to use and then I chose pink. I used pink range colors in my picture.

Then I started to write the functions in c++. It took 3 days to finish the functions. The hardest function to write was Updateimagedate for me,beacause it should be used in all functions.Then I wanted to test if  my functions work. Then I wrote a play.cfg to test, but I got 30000 empty files,then I realised my get_mbs_iter function has a problem. After fixing it I got some black pictures and finally I made some black and white pictures and I tested my functions with this pisture.(you can find the tests in tests file in my Azure account).
After all I wanted to give my picture some colors , and this is the result:

Then I thought about my idea for video. First a zoom , next a rotate, then 2 zooms in 2 different spots.I made around 300 pictures. For the video I gave every picture 0.2s time and I made a video which lasts for one minute.(You can find it in my Azure account in final video folder).
The last step was Music(which is my favorite part). I started to learn how sonic pi works.At first I made 4 songs in piano with different melodies and effects,but they were boring and like phone alarms, So I chose another instrument:Kalimba.
It took around one day to make the music. I test different notes to find something that I wanted.
Finally I made the video and you can find it in my Azure account in final video with music folder.

## Things which I learned:
Through this project I learned about structs and how can I use them.How to give them as a parameter to a function.Another was that I understood how functions can make working easy. Finally learned what fractals are and how intresting world they have in themselves!
